Dr. Michael Greger, M.D., states: "Dates are nature's candy - they contain natural sugars that provide quick energy, along with fiber that helps regulate blood sugar levels. This makes them ideal for breaking fasts as they provide immediate energy while preventing blood sugar spikes."`;

Dr. Walter Willett, M.D., Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health, states: "Extra virgin olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols, which have been shown in numerous studies to reduce inflammation and improve cardiovascular health.

Dr. Hans Bethe, Nobel Prize-winning Physicist (1967), and Dr. Fred Hoyle, Astrophysicist and Professor at Cambridge University, state: "Iron is formed in the cores of massive stars through nuclear fusion processes.
