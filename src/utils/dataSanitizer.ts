  // SPECIFIC FACTUAL SUMMARIES (more helpful and specific)
  if (title.includes("widespread ignorance")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: The Prophet (ﷺ) specifically warned that "knowledge will be taken away" and "ignorance will prevail" in later times. This hadith appears in Sunan Ibn Majah 4050 and has been authenticated by scholars through isnad analysis. The prophecy describes a time when religious knowledge becomes scarce despite widespread education.`;
  }

  if (title.includes("immorality")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: The Prophet (ﷺ) foretold that "immorality will become widespread" and people will "call good evil and evil good." This hadith from Sahih Bukhari 5590 describes a time when moral standards would be inverted. Scholars note this refers to the normalization of previously condemned behaviors.`;
  }

  if (title.includes("jesus") || title.includes("isa")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: The return of Jesus (Isa) is described in authentic hadith as occurring before the Day of Judgment. He will descend near Damascus, break the cross, kill the Dajjal, and establish justice. This is a major eschatological event agreed upon by all Islamic schools of thought.`;
  }

  if (title.includes("dates")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: The Prophet (ﷺ) said "When one of you breaks his fast, let him break it with dates" (إِذَا أَفْطَرَ أَحَدُكُمْ فَلْيُفْطِرْ عَلَى تَمْرٍ). Modern research confirms dates contain natural sugars and fiber - perfect for restoring energy after fasting.`;
  }

  if (title.includes("barley")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: Barley (شعير) is mentioned in Islamic texts. Modern studies show barley contains beta-glucan fiber that supports heart health and helps regulate blood sugar.`;
  }

  if (title.includes("honey")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: Honey is mentioned in Islamic texts for its beneficial properties. Modern research confirms honey's antibacterial properties and wound healing capabilities.`;
  }

  if (title.includes("black seed") || title.includes("nigella")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: Black seed (حبة السوداء) is mentioned in Islamic texts for its beneficial properties. Modern research shows Nigella sativa contains thymoquinone, which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.`;
  }

  if (title.includes("olive") || title.includes("olive oil")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: The Quran states "And [We brought forth] a tree issuing from Mount Sinai which produces oil and food for those who eat" (وَشَجَرَةً تَخْرُجُ مِن طُورِ سَيْنَاءَ تَنبُتُ بِالدُّهْنِ وَصِبْغٍ لِّلْآكِلِينَ) (23:20). Modern research confirms olive oil's high content of monounsaturated fats and polyphenols, which reduce inflammation and support heart health.`;
  }

Dr. Frank Press, former president of the National Academy of Sciences, notes that mountains have deep roots extending into the mantle, acting as stabilizers for tectonic plates through "isostatic equilibrium" - exactly as described in the Quran.`;
  }

  if (title.includes("expansion") || title.includes("universe")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: The Quran states "And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander" (وَالسَّمَاءَ بَنَيْنَاهَا بِأَيْدٍ وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ) (51:47). This predates Edwin Hubble's 1929 discovery of cosmic expansion by over 1300 years. Dr. Edwin Hubble's observations confirmed the universe is expanding.`;
  }

  if (title.includes("environmental") || title.includes("corruption")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: The Quran warns that "Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by [reason of] what the hands of people have earned" (ظَهَرَ الْفَسَادُ فِي الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِي النَّاسِ) (30:41). Dr. James Hansen's research (NASA) and the IPCC reports confirm human activities cause pollution, climate change, and ecosystem damage. This Quranic warning predates modern environmental awareness.`;
  }

  if (title.includes("iron") && title.includes("space")) {

Yes, [We are] Able [even] to proportion his fingertips" (أَيَحْسَبُ الْإِنسَانُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُ بَلَىٰ قَادِرِينَ عَلَىٰ أَن نُّسَوِّيَ بَنَانَهُ) (75:3-4). Dr. Francis Galton's research (1892) and subsequent studies by Dr. Henry Faulds confirm fingerprints are unique to each individual and remain unchanged throughout life.`;
  }

  if (title.includes("big bang") || title.includes("heaven earth joined")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: The Quran states "Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them" (أَوَلَمْ يَرَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَنَّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ كَانَتَا رَتْقًا فَفَتَقْنَاهُمَا) (21:30). Dr. George Gamow's research and Dr. Alan Guth's inflation theory confirm the universe began from a singularity and expanded, exactly matching this description. This predates the Big Bang theory by centuries.`;
  }

  if (title.includes("conquest") || title.includes("mecca")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: The Prophet (ﷺ) prophesied the peaceful conquest of Mecca. This occurred in 630 CE when the Prophet entered Mecca without bloodshed, cleansed the Kaaba of idols, and established monotheism. The conquest fulfilled multiple prophecies about Islam's spread.`;

  }

  if (title.includes("fingerprint") || title.includes("uniqueness")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: The Quran mentions Allah will resurrect humans with complete fingerprints (بَنَانَهُ) (75:4). Modern forensic science confirms fingerprints are unique to each individual and remain unchanged throughout life. This supports the Quranic claim of individual identity preservation.`;
  }

  if (title.includes("deep sea") || title.includes("darkness")) {
    return `FACTUAL SUMMARY: The Quran describes "Or [they are] like darknesses within an unfathomable sea which is covered by waves, upon which are waves, over which are clouds - darknesses, some of them upon others" (أَوْ كَظُلُمَاتٍ فِي بَحْرٍ لُّجِّيٍّ يَغْشَاهُ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِ سَحَابٌ ظُلُمَاتٌ بَعْضُهَا فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ) (24:40).
