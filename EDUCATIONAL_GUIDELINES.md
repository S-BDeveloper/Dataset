## Core Principles

- Focus on factual presentation of historical and textual data
- Maintain academic objectivity in all content

### 2. **Source Transparency**

- Provide references to scholarly works
- Acknowledge different scholarly perspectives

### 3. **User Responsibility**

- Encourage users to consult qualified scholars
- Provide disclaimers about educational nature

- Direct users to local religious authorities

## Content Guidelines

### Data Presentation

#### ✅ **Permitted Content**

- Direct quotes from authentic Islamic texts
- Historical facts and dates
- Scholarly references and citations
- Academic methodology descriptions
- Objective educational context
- **Quoted scholarly interpretations** (with proper attribution)
- **Scientific findings and correlations** (with peer-reviewed citations)
- **Multiple academic perspectives** on complex topics

#### ❌ **Prohibited Content**

- Personal interpretations of religious texts
- Subjective commentary on prophecies
- Modern-day applications without scholarly consensus
- Moral judgments or value statements
- Predictions about future events
- **Unattributed interpretations** (presenting as app's own view)
- **Single-perspective bias** (ignoring diverse scholarly opinions)
- **Outdated or discredited sources** without acknowledgment
- **Definitive statements** about complex theological matters

### Language Standards

#### Objective Language Examples

**Instead of:**

- "This prophecy has been fulfilled as ignorance has become widespread globally"
- "We see this manifested through various social changes"

**Use:**

- "This prophetic statement is recorded in Islamic texts"
- "Historical records provide various perspectives on this topic"

#### Status Classifications

**Instead of:**

- "Fulfilled" → "Historical Record"
- "Proven" → "Documented"
- "Yet to Happen" → "Future Event"

#### Scholarly Quotation Standards

**✅ Best Practices:**

- **Ijma (Consensus)**: "Islamic scholars have reached consensus that..."
- **Clear Attribution**: "According to Dr. [Name] in [Publication]..."
- **Contextual Introduction**: "Islamic scholars have various interpretations..."
- **Multiple Perspectives**: "While some scholars argue..., others suggest..."
- **Source Quality**: Prioritize peer-reviewed journals and recognized institutions
- **Delineation**: Clearly separate original text from interpretation
- **Scientific Rigor**: Use recent, verified scientific and academic sources

**❌ Avoid:**

- **Unattributed Claims**: "This means..." (without citation)
- **Single Perspective**: Presenting one interpretation as definitive
- **Outdated Sources**: Using discredited or outdated academic works
- **Blurred Lines**: Mixing original text with interpretation without distinction
- **Unverified Claims**: Presenting scientific correlations without peer-reviewed sources

## Implementation Guidelines
